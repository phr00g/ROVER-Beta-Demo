This is the story:

You are a grunt working for an intperplanetary materials company

You log into your ROVER, which although you just graduated from your academy you have 
pretty much no idea how to use.

You are told you are on a planet looking for suitable drilling sites, 
and that all reachable areas have been mapped and are on a grid, 
the red square indicated your current location

You are told that there may or may not be life on the planet,
but if there is, it is definitely not at all intelligent

You are told to find the x drillign sites, and retunr to your rover's landing afterwards

You are then connected to your rover, and all information received is given through it
ROVER: Something is happening here

you issue commands to move and do things

you encounter life forms that do not seem intellgient, and can be scanned to produce 
very poor quality images

some will stop you from testing drilling sites

at some point your signal is intercepted and links open on your computer
they offer cryptic messages and suggest that the life there is more intelligent than you belive
they offer reasons for you not to believe what your rover is telling you
they give you secret commands to tell your rover that confirm that they are intelligent

eventually your a given a picture of your rover, and you learn that your rover is massive
and towers over everythign else on the planet
